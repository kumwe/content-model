 * Signals that a content write quoted a version the stored record no longer carries.

 * editor holds a form open, so every change states the version it was composed against and is refused
 * outright when another writer got there first. Raising this rather than applying the write blind is
 * what stops two administrator screens from silently overwriting each other. The message names both
 * versions, and the JSON API maps it to `412 Precondition Failed`, so the remedy is always to reload
 * the record and retry rather than to retry the same payload.
